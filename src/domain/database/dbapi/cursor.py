Interface largely based and wrapping around Python DB API 2.0 (PEP 249).

These objects represent a database cursor, which is used to manage the context of a fetch operation. Cursors created 
from the same connection are not isolated, i.e., any changes done to the database by a cursor are immediately visible 
by the other cursors. Cursors created from different connections can or can not be isolated, depending on how the 
transaction support is implemented (see also the connection's .rollback() and .commit() methods).
